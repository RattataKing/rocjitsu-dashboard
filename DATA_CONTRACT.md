# RocJitsu Dashboard Data Contract

Schema version 1 uses plain JSON, immutable test catalogs, and one run file per RocJitsu plugin execution. A run file contains every target measured by that execution; target groups contain result records that reference the shared catalog.

## Published files

| Path | Contains | Changes when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data/metadata.json` | Contract version and site-level settings | The contract or site settings change |
| `data/index.json` | Publication time and run filenames | A run is added or removed |
| `data/test-catalogs/<catalog-id>.json` | An immutable test-definition snapshot and target applicability | The planned test set changes |
| `data/runs/<run-id>.json` | One plugin execution across every catalog target | A run is first published |

All files are copied to the built site without bundling. They must be valid JSON, not JavaScript.

Upload a new catalog before any run that references it. Upload run files before publishing the updated index. Existing catalogs and runs are immutable.

## Hosting requirements

The dashboard loads one HTTP request per published run, so the host must serve `data/` with cache headers that match each file's mutability.

| URL | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `data/metadata.json`, `data/index.json` | Must revalidate on every load, for example `Cache-Control: no-cache`. The browser also requests them with `cache: 'no-store'`. |
| `data/test-catalogs/*.json`, `data/runs/*.json` | Immutable once published; serve a long-lived `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` so repeat visits refetch only new runs. |

Publishing a mutated catalog or run under an existing filename is a contract violation: cached clients would keep the old body indefinitely. Publish a new ID instead.

## `metadata.json`

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "repository": "https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems",
  "isBeta": true
}
```

- `schemaVersion`: required integer; this contract requires `1`.
- `repository`: required repository URL used for source links.
- `isBeta`: required boolean controlling the header's Beta label.

Catalogs, targets, plugins, and run filenames do not belong in metadata.

## `index.json`

```json
{
  "generatedAt": "2026-09-09T04:15:15.135Z",
  "runFiles": [
    "runs/comparison-123-vanilla.json",
    "runs/comparison-123-asan.json",
    "runs/comparison-123-tsan.json"
  ]
}
```

- `generatedAt`: required ISO-8601 publication timestamp.
- `runFiles`: required array of unique paths relative to `index.json`. Each path must match `runs/<filename>.json`.

The index contains no catalog, target, plugin, or benchmark data.

An invalid, missing, or unreadable run is skipped and reported in the dashboard warning. A missing or invalid catalog invalidates each run that references it. Invalid dataset metadata or index structure remains fatal, as does a dataset with no usable completed Vanilla runs.

## Test catalog

A catalog is a complete immutable snapshot, not a diff from an earlier catalog.

```json
{
  "id": "rocjitsu-core-v2",
  "tests": [
    {
      "id": "gemm-fp16-1024",
      "suite": "GEMM",
      "name": "GEMM FP16 1024³",
      "problem": {
        "operation": "GEMM",
        "dataType": "fp16",
        "m": 1024,
        "n": 1024,
        "k": 1024
      }
    }
  ],
  "targets": {
    "gfx950": [
      "gemm-fp16-1024"
    ],
    "gfx1250": [
      "gemm-fp16-1024"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Catalog fields

- `id`: required stable, unique catalog identifier.
- `tests`: required array of benchmark definitions.
- `targets`: required object mapping each target to the exact test IDs applicable to it.

Every test contains:

- `id`: required plugin-neutral benchmark identity.
- `suite`: required dashboard grouping.
- `name`: required display name.
- `problem`: required object of workload facts. Keys must be non-empty; values must be strings, numbers, or booleans.

The dashboard renders every `problem` entry under **Problem Details**.

### Catalog evolution

- Never edit a published catalog.
- Add or remove tests by publishing a new catalog ID.
- Retain the same test ID only when `suite`, `name`, and `problem` are all unchanged.
- Use a new test ID for any other edit, including display-only changes to `suite` or `name`.
- Catalog versions may share any number of unchanged tests.
- Runs referencing a five-test catalog remain 5/5 after a seven-test catalog is introduced.

The browser derives the dashboard-wide picker from the union of referenced catalogs. No separate mutable current catalog exists.

Because that union is keyed by test ID, a shared test ID must carry an identical `suite`, `name`, and `problem` in every catalog that defines it. There is no authoritative winner when two catalogs disagree, so the dashboard rejects the whole dataset and names both catalogs rather than silently comparing different workloads. Renaming a published test therefore costs its history continuity; that price buys the guarantee that one test ID always means one workload.

## Run file

A run represents one RocJitsu plugin execution on one source revision and machine, across all targets required by its catalog.

```json
{
  "id": "comparison-123-asan",
  "comparisonId": "comparison-123",
  "testCatalog": "test-catalogs/rocjitsu-core-v2.json",
  "plugin": {
    "id": "asan",
    "name": "AddressSanitizer",
    "version": "LLVM 20"
  },
  "source": {
    "branch": "develop",
    "commit": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
    "committedAt": "2026-09-08T10:42:00.000Z",
    "message": "Improve clocked-mode batching"
  },
  "execution": {
    "completedAt": "2026-09-08T12:00:00.000Z",
    "trigger": "auto",
    "machine": "sjc-rocjitsu-perf-01"
  },
  "environment": [
    {
      "key": "rocmSdkVersion",
      "label": "ROCm SDK",
      "value": "7.2.0"
    }
  ],
  "targets": [
    {
      "id": "gfx1250",
      "results": [
        {
          "testId": "gemm-fp16-1024",
          "durationSeconds": 2.82,
          "status": "completed",
          "exitCode": 0,
          "error": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Run and comparison identity

- `id`: required unique plugin-execution ID.
- `comparisonId`: required controlled-experiment ID shared by Vanilla, ASan, TSan, UBSan, or other plugin runs.
- `testCatalog`: required path matching `test-catalogs/<filename>.json`.

Do not give plugin executions the same `id`. For different plugins to share a `comparisonId`, they must have identical catalog, source, trigger, machine, environment, and target sets. Their completion times and result values may differ.

Normal performance history, Overview, Run Comparison, Benchmarks, and Failures use only the `vanilla` plugin. The Plugin Comparison list includes only compatible controlled comparisons containing Vanilla and at least one non-Vanilla plugin, and renders each target selected in the global filter without adding a second target picker.

### `plugin`

- `id`: required stable identifier, such as `vanilla`, `asan`, or `tsan`.
- `name`: required display name.
- `version`: optional plugin or toolchain version.
- `options`: optional object containing plugin-specific configuration.

The uninstrumented baseline is:

```json
{
  "id": "vanilla",
  "name": "Vanilla"
}
```

Plugin identity and options do not belong in `environment`, because plugins are the intentional comparison dimension.

### `source`

- `branch`: required and currently must be `develop`.
- `commit`: required full SHA of the tested RocJitsu commit.
- `committedAt`: required ISO-8601 timestamp of that commit.
- `message`: optional commit message.

Historical reruns preserve the source commit's original `committedAt`.

### `execution`

- `completedAt`: required ISO-8601 timestamp for the completed plugin execution.
- `trigger`: required; exactly `auto` or `manual`.
- `machine`: required stable runner name shared by every target in the run.

Target identity is intentionally absent from `execution`; targets are grouped under `targets`.

### `environment`

`environment` is a required array of shared execution details and may be empty. Items contain:

- `key`: stable identifier, unique within the run.
- `label`: display label.
- `value`: string, number, or boolean.

Array order and labels do not affect compatibility; normalized key/value pairs do. Two empty environments are compatible. An empty and populated environment are not.

### `targets` and results

`targets` must contain exactly one group for every target defined by the referenced catalog. Each group contains:

- `id`: target architecture such as `gfx950` or `gfx1250`.
- `results`: exactly one result for every test ID listed under `catalog.targets[id]`.

The result identity is `(run id, target id, testId)`. Plugin comparison identity is `(comparisonId, target id, testId)`.

Every result contains:

- `testId`: required catalog test ID.
- `durationSeconds`: numeric seconds for a completed result; `null` for failed or timed-out results.
- `status`: required; `completed`, `failed`, or `timeout`.
- `exitCode`: process exit code or `null`.
- `error`: failure description or `null`.
- `findings`: optional array of structured sanitizer findings.

A finding contains required `type` and `summary` strings and an optional `location`.

Failed and timed-out tests must remain in `results`. Omitting a catalog result invalidates the run instead of silently changing its denominator.

## Plugin comparison calculations

Plugin comparison always occurs within one `comparisonId` and one target. Vanilla is the default baseline.

```text
duration change (%) = (plugin duration - baseline duration) / baseline duration × 100
speedup             = baseline duration / plugin duration
```

The overall runtime overhead is the geometric mean of per-test duration ratios. When every selected test is comparable, the value is exact. When only some tests pass for both the plugin and baseline, the dashboard measures the geometric-mean overhead from those passed pairs and assumes the same overhead for the entire selected test set. This whole-set estimate is marked with `*` and reports how many passed pairs contributed. Failed, timed-out, missing, and baseline-incomplete results contribute no measured ratio; they receive the passed-pair overhead assumption. No estimate is shown when no passed pair exists.

## Publishing checklist

1. Choose an existing immutable catalog or publish a new catalog first.
2. Run Vanilla and each instrumented plugin against the catalog's complete target/test matrix.
3. Give each plugin execution a unique `id` and the same controlled `comparisonId`.
4. Include exactly one completed, failed, or timed-out result for every catalog test applicable to every target.
5. Upload each `data/runs/<run-id>.json`.
6. Add the run filenames to `data/index.json`, update `generatedAt`, and publish the index last.

No React or Vite build is required for a data-only GitHub Pages update.

## Values derived by the dashboard

Do not publish aggregate duration, runtime overhead, speedup, baselines, deltas, coverage percentages, reliability percentages, comparison counts, chart labels, colors, or layout. The browser derives them from catalogs and run results.
